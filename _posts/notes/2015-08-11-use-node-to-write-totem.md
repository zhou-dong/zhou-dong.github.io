title: Use node.js to rewrite totem project

---

I think may be it is the time to use the Node.js to rewrite the core of totem project.

1. I should name my project.
2. Create a prototype of the totem App

pre:
1. Study the node.js again
2. To know what is the express of nodejs
3. To know what is grunt.
4. to know how to export and require node module.
