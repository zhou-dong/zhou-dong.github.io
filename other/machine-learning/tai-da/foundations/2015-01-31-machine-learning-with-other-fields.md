##### Definition of Machine Learning:
**Use `data` to compute `hypothesis` $$g$$ that approximates `target` $$\ f$$**

##### Relation with Data Mining
- use `huge` data to find property that is interesting.
- ML = DM (usually what KDD cups does).
- DM can help ML, and vice versa.
- Traditional DM also focus on `efficent computation in large database`.

##### Relation with Artifical Intelligence
- AI: Compute something that show intelligent behavior.
- `ML can realize AI`, among other routers.

##### Relation With Statistics
- Statistics: use data to make inference about unknown process.
- $$g$$ is an inference outcome; $$f$$ is something unknown.
- `Statistics can be used to achieve ML`.
- Traditional statistics also focus on `provable results with math assumption`, and care less about `computation`.
