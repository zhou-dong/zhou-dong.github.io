#### Machine Learning: acquiring skill
- observations --> learning --> skill
- date --> ML --> skil

#### Skill:
Improving some performance measure with experience computed from data.

#### Use Scenarios:
- Can not progam the system manually
    - Navigation of Mars
- Human can not define the solution easily
    - speech/visual recognition
- Need rapid decisions than human can not do
    - high-frequency trading
- need to be user-oriented in massive scale
    - consumer-targeted marketing (different consumer use different strategy)

#### Key Essecnce of Machine Learning
1. Some `underlying pattern` to be learned
2. `No` programmable (easy) definition
3. Somehow there is `data` about the pattern
