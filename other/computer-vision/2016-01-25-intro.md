Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions.

- Sampling: digitizing the coordinate values 
- Quantization: digitizing the amplitude values

- Image resolution: the largest number of discernible line pairs per unit distance 
- Intensity resolution: the smallest discernible change in intensity level, usually refer to the number of bits used to quantize intensity

Histograms

- A histogram is a graph. A graph that shows frequency of anything. Usually histogram have bars that represent frequency of occurring of data in the whole data set.

- Histogram of an image, like other histograms also shows frequency. But an image histogram, shows frequency of pixels intensity values. In an image histogram, the x axis shows the gray level intensities and the y axis shows the frequency of these intensities.
