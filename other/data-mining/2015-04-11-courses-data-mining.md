- Pattern Discovery in Data Mining
    1. A Brief Introduction to Data Mining
        + We are drowning in Data but straving for knowledge!
        + Necessity is the mother of invention
        + Knowledge mining from Data
    2. Pattern Discovery: Basic Concepts
    3. Efficient Pattern Mining Methods
        + Down closure Property of Frequent Pattern (Apriori) 
        + Any subset of frequent itemset must be frequent
        + If any subset of an itemset S infrequent, then there is no change for S to be frequent
        + I think it is kind of Dynamic Programming
        + Scalable mining methods: 3 major approaches
        + Apriori
        + Eclat
        + FPgrowth
    4. Pattern Evaluation
        + Objective: By math to calculate
        + Subjective: One man's trash could be another man's treasure
    5. Mining Diverse Frequdent Patterns
    6. Constraint-Based Pattern Mining
    7. Sequential Pattern Mining
    8. Graph Pattern Mining
    9. Pattern-Based Classification
    10. Pattern Analysis: Application Exploration
    11. Futher Topics on Pattern Analysis
