Hi my name is Dong Zhou. I have been working in China 6 years as a software engineer. When I was in China, I have been worked in two company, which were Vodone and Gome online.

During I was in Vodone. We use Java, Spring Struts and Hibernate, Mysql and Tomcat and JSTL, El expression to build our Shopping Online System. Those things were kind of traditional Java technology. At that time, I was in the Shopping Cart Team, we build all the shopping cart functions from frontend to backend.

When I was in Gome Online. Gome Online is also a shopping online website. I was in the Search Engine Team. We build our own distributed system, which were micro-services architecture, to handle the search requests. We ZeroMQ to build our own socket server. And register our servers to the Zookeeper. So we could know the status of servers, which were running ok and which were crushed. After that we add the Solr as a module into our servers. We used the MongoDB as the backup database, and used Redis as the memory cache. And used the LevelDB as the local cache. My responsibility in search team is implement the search functions and I also build a distributed schedule system.

I was in Search team for two and half years, so I realized that data is the future, but I didn't know the Data Mining Algorithms or Machine Learning algorithms, I also realized I should review my basic knowledge, so I quit my job and came to America to pursuit my Master Degree.

When I was in Troy, I took the Machine Learning class in campus also in online resources like Coursera and YouTube. I also learned python and R language for machine learning. Also I was really interested in NodeJS. Cause itâ€™s amazing. I learned NodeJs, ExpressJs, ReactJS and D3Js all by myself. I was a Computer Lab Assistant in Troy, so I used Docker to build Hadoop system for the computer lab. I also learned Scala language to operate the spark.

Now I am looking for a job.

What is your expectation for the future of the job? Is that must machine learning?

No, I like machine learning, but now it is just like other technologies, I also like NodeJs or to build a system. I think the technology is important, but more important is to build something really useful to the world. So I want to join a cool company to make things useful and cool to the world or people.

When I was working in the company, I was more focused on the build the system, but during I was in college, I been learned different kind of technologies and ideas. May be because I had 6 years working experience so I could learn things faster.
