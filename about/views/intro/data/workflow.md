I was in search team, if company had a big project, serval people will be selected from different team to join an individual team to create that project. Leader by a Project Manager.

Normally each person response for a part of the team, but every server months, we will host a group meeting, engineer could send request to switch the position. Switchs position inside a team is easier between teams.

All the bugs will be sent to whole team members, normally people will pick up the bugs, if the bug was not clear the responsible manager will assign the bug to specific person to fix.
