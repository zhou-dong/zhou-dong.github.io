		<div class="panel-heading">Self Introduction</div>
		<div class="panel-body"><p>Hi my name is Dong Zhou. I have been working in China 6 years as a software engineer. When I was in China, I have been worked in two company, which were Vodone and Gome online.</p>

<p>During I was in Vodone. We use Java, Spring Struts and Hibernate, Mysql and Tomcat and JSTL, El expression to build our Shopping Online System. Those things were kind of traditional Java technology. At that time, I was in the Shopping Cart Team, we build all the shopping cart functions from frontend to backend.</p>

<p>When I was in Gome Online. Gome Online is also a shopping online website. I was in the Search Engine Team. We build our own distributed system, which were micro-services architecture, to handle the search requests. We ZeroMQ to build our own socket server. And register our servers to the Zookeeper. So we could know the status of servers, which were running ok and which were crushed. After that we add the Solr as a module into our servers. We used the MongoDB as the backup database, and used Redis as the memory cache. And used the LevelDB as the local cache. My responsibility in search team is implement the search functions and I also build a distributed schedule system.</p>

<p>I was in Search team for two and half years, so I realized that data is the future, but I didn&#39;t know the Data Mining Algorithms or Machine Learning algorithms, I also realized I should review my basic knowledge, so I quit my job and came to America to pursuit my Master Degree.</p>

<p>When I was in Troy, I took the Machine Learning class in campus also in online resources like Coursera and YouTube. I also learned python and R language for machine learning. Also I was really interested in NodeJS. Cause it’s amazing. I learned NodeJs, ExpressJs, ReactJS and D3Js all by myself. I was a Computer Lab Assistant in Troy, so I used Docker to build Hadoop system for the computer lab. I also learned Scala language to operate the spark.</p>

<p>Now I am looking for a job.</p>

<hr/>

<p>What is your expectation for the future of the job? Is that must machine learning?</p>

<p>No, I like machine learning, but now it is just like other technologies, I also like NodeJs or to build a system. I think the technology is important, but more important is to build something really useful to the world. So I want to join a cool company to make things useful and cool to the world or people.</p>

<p>When I was working in the company, I was more focused on the build the system, but during I was in college, I been learned different kind of technologies and ideas. May be because I had 6 years working experience so I could learn things faster.</p></div>

			How to handle the biggest challenge
		</div>
	  	<div class="panel-body"><p>When I just joined my second company in China, the company provided the pre-training for the new employee. At the time, I just knew my wife, and I thought I knew all the technologies the company used, and I don&#39;t need to training. So I didn&#39;t pay attention for the training. But after I joined the team and start to work, I found the technologies were so different with my previous job.</p>

<p>Those times were very hard to me, I even didn’t know which way to start to catch up with other colleagues, I took very long time to read the document, and google all the ideas by myself. I thought I should pay attention on the training.</p>

<p>After that I realized I too arrogant, which make my foolish. I should stay humble. Like Steve Jobs said: Stay hungry, stay foolish. And If you know something going to be happen in the future, please prepared as earlier as possible. And respect to other people&#39;s work.</p></div>

		<div class="panel-heading">Work Flow</div>
	  	<div class="panel-body"><p>I was in search team, if company had a big project, serval people will be selected from different team to join an individual team to create that project. Leader by a Project Manager.</p>

<p>Normally each person response for a part of the team, but every server months, we will host a group meeting, engineer could send request to switch the position. Switchs position inside a team is easier between teams.</p>

<p>All the bugs will be sent to whole team members, normally people will pick up the bugs, if the bug was not clear the responsible manager will assign the bug to specific person to fix.</p></div>
